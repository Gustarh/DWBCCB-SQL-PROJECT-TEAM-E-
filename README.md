DWBCC6 CAPSTONE SQL PROJECT(TEAM E)
## Project/Goals

 Exploring generated insights using data driven approach
## Process

Ask stage: question asking and problem idetifying stage.
Prepare stage: importing of data into the database for analysis.
Process Stage: data cleaning and exploratory stage.
Analyze stage: the problem solving stage.

## Results
The data revealed the total listings in Capetown airbnb, the host with the highest listing as well as property type with the most listing. it also revealed average price of listings and also the average review. This would help determine the best listing to book.

## Challenges

We were unable to split the name column in the listings table. The name column contains extra irrelevant variables. We were also unable to deal with the Null and N/A values because deleting them would affect our analysis as they are so many. Hence,we analyzed our data while ignoring them.

## Future Goals

(would have explored more of the dataset by handling the Null Values Properly)
